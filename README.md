# Sol2E
A component based mini game engine on top of Microsoft's XNA Framework.

This was a student project I did in 2012 which slightly overshot the target but was great fun nonetheless. It started as more of a programming practise to implement a component slash entity system based on [a series of articles](http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/) at [t-machine.org](http://t-machine.org/).

As of its current state, there is not much use to it anymore since [XNA has been discontinued](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/185894/Its_official_XNA_is_dead.php). But who knows. Maybe I'll do a port to [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) one day.

In the mean time, if you are really interested check out [the documentation](https://rawgit.com/chriskapffer/Sol2E/master/doc/generated/Index.html). There is also [a pdf file](https://rawgit.com/chriskapffer/Sol2E/master/Sol2E_Bericht.pdf) which discusses some implementation details, the general architecture and some shortcommings of the project (you know, the stuff a prof likes to read about). You'll have to speak german to understand it though.

Oh, and in case you were wondering about the project's name: As someone who really struggles at naming things I usually fall back to building acronyms out of something that I consider to be cool. In this case 'Sol2E' refers to a letter from from Sol LeWitt to Eva Hesse, which I stumbled upon and thought was kinda inspirational. You can read it [here](https://jwvpk.wordpress.com/2009/03/10/letter-from-sol-lewitt-to-eva-hesse/).
